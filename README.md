**A-Frame VR Project Setup Guide**

This is a simple A-Frame VR project that can be set up easily on any web server. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project:

**rerequisites**
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following:

A web server to host the project files
A modern web browser with support for WebXR API
**Project setup**
1. Create a new directory for the project on your local machine.
2. Create an HTML file with any name of your choice (e.g. index.html) and copy the code snippet provided in the project description into it.
3. Create a new directory within the project directory called assets and copy the 80.jpeg, 80-2.jpeg, and nfl-stadiums-grass-or-turf-scaled.jpg files into it.
4. Save the HTML file and all assets to the project directory.
**Running the project**
To run the project, follow the steps below:

1. Start your web server and ensure that the project files are served from its root directory.
2. Open a modern web browser and navigate to the URL of your web server. The URL should be in the format http://localhost:<port_number>/ where <port_number> is the port number of your web server.
3. The VR world should now be displayed in your web browser. You can navigate around the world using your mouse, touchpad, or VR headset.
#Additional notes
If you're hosting the project on a remote server, replace localhost in the URL with the IP address or domain name of the server.
You can modify the VR world by changing the code in the HTML file. For example, you can replace the sky image with a different image by modifying the src attribute of the a-sky element. You can also replace the 3D model of the football with a different model by modifying the gltf-model attribute of the a-entity element.
You can add interactivity to the VR world using A-Frame components. Visit the A-Frame documentation for more information on A-Frame components.
